# Senior-iOS-Onsite-Prep
A repo of a Swift Playground / Project that I used to study for senior iOS engineer onsites, and a study plan to accompany. 

## Study Plan & Resources

#### Swift Syntax / Features (Playground)
- An overview of the syntax of Swift, and the way the language works. 

[ ] - Implementation of all types, and notations about each type's relevant usage, time complexity, and other fun tidbits (protocols, structs, classes, enums, etc). 
[ ] - Implementation of closures with different syntaxes, functions, and other codeblocks within classes and structs. 
[ ] - Implementation of control transfer statements and control flows (if / else / switch / while, etc)
[ ] - Methods of unwrapping an optional variable 
[ ] - Implementation of extensions, and using them to add methods, subscripts, and modifing string outputs. 

#### * Resources Used *
[ ] - Apple's free Swift 5 book

#### Design Patterns (Playground)
- An overview of the design patterns that someone may use to solve lower-level implementation problems. 

[ ] - Chain of Responsibility
[ ] - Command
[ ] - Interpreter
[ ] - Iterator
[ ] - Mediator
[ ] - Memento
[ ] - Observer / Master
[ ] - State
[ ] - Strategy
[ ] - Visitor
[ ] - Template Method
[ ] - Abstract Factory
[ ] - Builder 
[ ] - Factory Method 
[ ] - Monostate 
[ ] - Prototypes
[ ] - Singletons
[ ] - Adapters
[ ] - Bridge
[ ] - Composites
[ ] - Decorator
[ ] - Facade 
[ ] - Flyweight
[ ] - Protection Proxy
[ ] - Virtual Proxy

#### * Resources Used *
[ ] - 

#### Architectural Patterns (Project)
- An overview of high level architectural patterns that can involve a view, and potentially some backend patterns that can be useful for development. Note that I included implementation of back-end architectural patterns as well, although this was more for my own education as opposed to something that I think a senior iOS dev must know. 

[ ] - MVC (Front-end)
[ ] - MVVM (Front-end)
[ ] - VIPER (Front-end)
[ ] - Domain based architecture mockup (Organization pattern)
[ ] - Service based architecture mockup (Organization pattern)
[ ] - Microservice mockup (Back-end)
[ ] - Monolith mockup (Back-end)

#### * Resources Used *
[ ] - "Hands On Design Patterns with Swift"
[ ] - "Building Evolutionary Architecture"
[ ] - "Designing Data Intensive Applications" 
[ ] - 

#### Data Structures (Playground)
- Common data structures that may be used in day to day programming, and information about their time & space complexity. 

[ ] - Arrays
[ ] - Dictionaries
[ ] - Linked Lists
[ ] - Doubly Linked Lists
[ ] - Trees
[ ] - Binary Trees (as linked nodes and as matrix)
[ ] - Binary Search Trees (as linked nodes and as matrix)
[ ] - Tries
[ ] - Graphs (As adjency lists and as a matrix)

#### * Resources Used *
[ ] - Leetcode Data Structures & Algorithms Course
[ ] - "Data Structured & Algorithms in Swift" by Kelvin Lau & Vincent Ngo

#### Algorithms (Playground)
- A very surface level review of basic search, sorting, and other relevant problem solving algorithms. 

[ ] - Binary Search

#### * Resources Used *
[ ] - Leetcode Data Structures & Algorithms Course
[ ] - "Data Structured & Algorithms in Swift" by Kelvin Lau & Vincent Ngo

#### UIKit / Frameworks Review (Playground & Project)
- Implementation of many UIKit components programatically, as well as implementation of other Apple & 3rd party frameworks. Some of these need to be used within an actual Xcode project instead of a Swift playground, so keep in mind this is for practicing implementation and muscle memory and not for compliation. 

#### * Resources Used *
[ ] - Apple UIKit Documentation

#### Real World Programming (Project)
- This is a general section to describe things I programmed that would actually be used day to day within the course of an iOS engineer. 

[ ] - Implementation of a module that contains entities, and sends / recieves requests and encodes them into the entities with proper error handling. 
[ ] - Implementation of a fully programmatic UI in an application sans Storyboard
[ ] - Implementation of a fully storyboarded UI that utilizes @IB
[ ] - Implementation of purposefully bad code with memory leaks / performance issues for debugging purposes
[ ] - Implementation of correct code that fixes problems mentioned above.
